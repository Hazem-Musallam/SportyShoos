Main Notes. 
Firstly  You Have To Have A database Named store with root UN and 123 PW 
Tomcat Run Over 9091

also when you start The Application You Will be aple to use the system (ADMIN) with UN:-> (spl) and password:-> (spl)
after login you can add edit products , add Caategories , show the reports and users also change the password (6 Characters )

Cons -> 
we can use Cart For making the system more Frindly to store all users item in the session . 

the way that the JDBC configured can be used also to creat Multi Datasources .
